# About Me 

## A Few Words

My name is Amira, and I am a student with a passion for languages, books, and exploring new places.

Small Journeys is where I share my love for local travel, around France and its neighboring regions. I believe in the beauty of slow, thoughtful journeys, where you can truly soak in the culture, discover hidden gems, and enjoy the local food.

This blog is a space for fellow travelers who love simple adventures, meaningful experiences, and, of course, great food. Whether it’s wandering through a quiet village or trying a new dish, I’m excited to take you along on my journey.

## How I Like to Travel

I believe in the beauty of slowing down and truly savoring the journey. For me, travel isn’t about rushing from one destination to the next—it's about exploring the charm that exists all around us. Whether it's a quiet town or a hidden path, there’s always something special to discover nearby.

I avoid flying whenever I can, preferring to take the scenic routes by train, bus, or even on foot. It’s a more mindful way to travel, allowing me to connect with the places and people I encounter along the way. I also choose not to share my travels on social media, as I find the experience more fulfilling when it's personal and uninterrupted. Traveling at a slower pace helps me appreciate the simple joys of the road, and that’s the heart of my journey.
